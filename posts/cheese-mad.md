## The past two weeks: A Blast of Learning, Coding, and Connecting! ðŸš€

### ðŸ§€ Cheesehacks at UW Madison
Two weekends ago, I dived into the exciting world of Cheesehacks at UW Madison. Along with Max, Manny, and Jayden, we developed **CheesePlanner.io**, a planner web app. This application, leveraging Spaced-Repetition and Pomodoro methods, offers automatic study plan generation. Using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, HTML, and CSS, my focus was on creating an intuitive UI with React-Bootstrap and ensuring a smooth frontend to database connection. I'm proud of how we created a running app within 24 hours, especially as most of us were new to React!

### ðŸ”¥ Madhacks 2023
Last weekend at Madhacks 2023, I teamed up with Gavin and Vincent to create **Beat A GM**, a Chess Puzzle Game Web App focused on positional gameplay. Built with MySQL, Express.js, React, Node.js, Firebase, HTML, and CSS, it offers advanced training using historical grandmaster game data. I concentrated on applying advanced OOP principles in JavaScript for functionality, maintainability, and bug-free experience. Our work on simulated DOM testing was crucial in optimizing the user experience. Current enhancements include adding authentication functions and improving the game scoring system.

Balancing these hackathons with a schedule of five exams was challenging but thrilling. These experiences fueled my passion for technology and innovation. In my spare time, I'm continually enhancing these projects, adding more features and functionalities.

A huge shoutout to the organizers of Cheesehacks and Madhacks. These events not only honed my technical skills but also instilled a deeper appreciation for teamwork, creativity, and resilience.
